A simple example of a dependently-typed regular expression library.

This code goes along with talks given at 
[Haskell eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/12195-keynote-dependent-types-in-haskell),
[POPL17](../talks/influence.pptx) and
[StrangeLoop17](../talks/strangeloop17.pptx).

This code is not intended to be production quality. There are many faster and
more robust libraries for regular expression matching in Haskell. Instead,
this code demonstrates the major aspects of dependently-typed programming in
Haskell.

See [Example.hs](Example.hs) for an example of the library in action.

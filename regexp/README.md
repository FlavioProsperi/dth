A simple example of a dependently-typed regular expression library.

This code goes along with talks given at [POPL17](../popl17) and
[StrangeLoop17](../strangeloop17).

It is not intended to be production quality. There are many faster and more
robust libraries for regular expression matching in Haskell. Instead, this
code demonstrates the major aspects of dependently-typed programming in
Haskell.

See [Regexp.hs](Regexp.hs) for an example of the library in action.
